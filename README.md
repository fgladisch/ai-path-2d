AIPath2D
==========

This AI is a reimplementation of the movement script "AIPath" which comes with the [A* Pathfinding Project](http://arongranberg.com/astar) for [Unity](http://unity3d.com), but for 2D games. As it was stated in the documentation of the original script "It is in no way required by the rest of the system, so feel free to write your own.", and that is what I did. Calculations and transformations are made on the XY plane, which is the default for 2D Games in Unity, instead of the XZ plane used in the original script.


This script is in no way ready, nor is it perfect, but I hope it will be useful as a starting point for 2D game projects that are using the A* Pathfinding Project. I will, however, continue to work on this.
